			<h1>Summary of <div class="title">Tricycle Taxi: The Pedicab Musical:</div></h1>
			<h4>Life isn’t always easy for Jersey, a pedicabber in downtown Austin. To start, he has a demanding boss, Antony, whose erratic behavior ranges from epic generosity to plotting revenge at those who owe him money. Pedicabbing the streets of Austin used to be a dream job. That is, until the SNAKES showed up. Ya see, they’re a group of pedicabbers who break the cardinal, unspoken rule of pedicabbing: don’t snake, or steal, other pedicabbers rides. These guys not only SNAKE rides with pride, they use their intimidating SNAKE hiss to prevent other pedicabbers from standing up to them. On top of all that, Antony assigned Jersey to train his hapless roommate Glen, whose personality is, let’s say, an acquired taste. And by the way did I mention it was the last night of South by Southwest? It’s Jersey’s last chance to make enough money to quit working for Antony and buy a pedicab of his own design. That’s his dream.</h4>

			<h4>One bright spot in Jersey’s night is Jackleen, who, unbeknownst to Jersey, is a SNAKE and the daughter of head SNAKE Robert Laroux. Oooh boy, Laroux’s name strike fear into pedicabbers’ hearts, especially Jersey’s. Laroux sees that Jersey has taken a liking to Jackleen and tries to get her to manipulate Jersey for Laroux’s benefit. Jackleen is caught in a tough spot when the big race that will determine who will stay a pedicabber in Austin leaves her deciding between her dad, Robert Laroux, and her new love interest Jersey. Jersey finally stands up to Laroux and challenges him to a big race, but will his soft spot for Jackleen be his downfall? Will Jersey’s dream of ever having his own pedicab come true? And was his connection with Jackleen ever real? Find out in, Tricycle Taxi: The Pedicab Musical.</h4>
